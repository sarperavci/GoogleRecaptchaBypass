## Features

- Automatically solves Google's reCAPTCHA challenges.
- Uses asynchronous downloading to speed up audio CAPTCHA processing.
- Converts audio files to text using Google Speech Recognition.
- Checks if the reCAPTCHA is solved with just a click before proceeding to the bypass technique.

## Usage

To implement this script in your project, you can follow a similar approach as shown below:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from RecaptchaSolver import RecaptchaSolver

# Initialize the WebDriver options
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("--incognito")
options.add_experimental_option("excludeSwitches", ["enable-automation", "enable-logging"])

driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
driver.get("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")
recaptchaSolver = RecaptchaSolver(driver)

try:
    # Perform CAPTCHA solving
    recaptchaSolver.solveCaptcha()

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    driver.quit()
```

I have created `test.py` to demonstrate the usage of this script. You can run the `test.py` file to see the script in action.

    
    python test.py
    

## Code Structure

- `RecaptchaSolver.py`: Contains the `RecaptchaSolver` class with methods to solve the reCAPTCHA.
- `test.py`: Example usage of the `RecaptchaSolver` class.
