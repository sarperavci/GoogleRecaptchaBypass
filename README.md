[**Scrapeless Browser**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-browser?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci) is a cloud-based, Chromium-powered headless browser cluster. It allows developers to run large-scale, low-cost concurrent browser instances and reliably handle complex interactions on protected pages. Ideal for AI infrastructure, web automation, data scraping, page rendering, automated testing, and other tasks that require a real browser environment.  
**Key Advantages of Scrapeless Browser:**

* **Built-in CAPTCHA solving:** Automatically bypasses Cloudflare Turnstile, reCAPTCHA, AWS WAF, DataDome, and other challenge systems.  
* **Undetectable browser environment:** Not based on the traditional WebDriver ‚Äî avoids automation detection.  
* **Massive concurrency support:** Run 50‚Äì10,000+ browser instances simultaneously with no server constraints.  
* **Real-time debugging:** Live View and session recording for efficient troubleshooting.  
* **Native integration:** Compatible with Puppeteer, Playwright, Python, and Node.js ‚Äî easy to integrate into your current workflows.  
* **70M+ residential IPs:** Global proxy network with automatic rotation and smart geolocation routing.

In terms of cost, Scrapeless browser usage is only 1/8 of Browserbase, significantly cutting overall expenses.  
It also offers a [**Scraping API**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-api?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci)**„ÄÅ[Deep SerpApi](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/deep-serp-api?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci) and [Proxies](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/proxies?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci) services**.

## Installation
Three dependencies are required to run this script. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, you need to install ffmpeg. You can download it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## Usage

To implement this script in your project, you can follow a similar approach as shown below:

```python
from DrissionPage import ChromiumPage 
from RecaptchaSolver import RecaptchaSolver
driver = ChromiumPage()
recaptchaSolver = RecaptchaSolver(driver)
driver.get("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")
recaptchaSolver.solveCaptcha()
```

I have created `test.py` to demonstrate the usage of this script. You can run the `test.py` file to see the script in action.


## Demo

## How does it work?

We automate the browser to solve the reCAPTCHA. Instead of image captcha, we are solving the audio captcha. The audio captcha is easier to solve programmatically.

**One warning:** Google may block your IP if you solve too many captchas in a short period of time. So, use this script wisely or change your IP frequently.
