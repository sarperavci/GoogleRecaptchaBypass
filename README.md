[**Scrapeless**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci-cap) is an all-in-one, enterprise-grade, and highly scalable data scraping solution built for developers and businesses. Beyond the Scraping Browser, it also offers a [**Scraping API**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-api?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci-cap), [**Deep SerpAPI**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/deep-serp-api?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci-cap), and robust [proxy services](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/proxies?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=sarperavci-cap).

## Installation
Three dependencies are required to run this script. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, you need to install ffmpeg. You can download it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## Usage

To implement this script in your project, you can follow a similar approach as shown below:

```python
from DrissionPage import ChromiumPage 
from RecaptchaSolver import RecaptchaSolver
driver = ChromiumPage()
recaptchaSolver = RecaptchaSolver(driver)
driver.get("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")
recaptchaSolver.solveCaptcha()
```

I have created `test.py` to demonstrate the usage of this script. You can run the `test.py` file to see the script in action.


## Demo

## How does it work?

We automate the browser to solve the reCAPTCHA. Instead of image captcha, we are solving the audio captcha. The audio captcha is easier to solve programmatically.

**One warning:** Google may block your IP if you solve too many captchas in a short period of time. So, use this script wisely or change your IP frequently.
